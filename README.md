# stock-analysis-2

## Project Overview

Our client was interested in recommending a "green" stock to their parents.  They were particularly interested in 12 stocks to beginwith with the focus on ticker "DQ", as the "green" stock they were looking to recommend.  We suggested looking at stock performance of a few related stocked during 2017 and 2018.  We analyzed the total trading volume and the percent return over the course of these years individually.  We then used this analysis to provide feedback to our client so that they could recommend a stock to their parents.
